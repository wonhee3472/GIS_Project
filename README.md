# Crime in Chicago
After Dana (my wife) is finished with her grad school in about 1.5 years later from now, we are planning on moving back to one of the suburbs in Chicago. But we want to go somewhere safe where there isn't that much crime activity in the area. This data exploration and visualization will help us to decide which area we'd like to choose as our next home in Chicago. 

# Approach
I accessed the data extracted from the [Chicago Police Department](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-One-year-prior-to-present/x2n5-8w5q) by using the Sodapy library and Socrata Open Data API. With the extracted and modified dataset, I mapped the coordinates of arrest made in Chicago in Jan 2022 by using the Kepler library.

# Result
To see the steps I took to do analysis, click here [Chicago_Crime](https://github.com/wonhee3472/GIS_Project/blob/main/Chicago%20Crime.ipynb).
To see the result of the analysis, clicking the [chicago_arrests.html](https://github.com/wonhee3472/GIS_Project/blob/main/chicago_arrests.html) won't work. You probably have to clone this repostitory and open it with jupyter notebook in the environment where you have `geopandas` and `keplergl` installed.
